I am a curious and motivated learner with a strong interest in exploring how technology can solve real-life problems. I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into simpler parts and finding efficient solutions. Programming excites me because it combines logic, creativity, and problem-solving in a way that constantly challenges me to think differently.
1)Web Development: Designing and building interactive, user-friendly websites.
2)Game Development: Creating simple games to practice logic, loops, and events.
3)Problem Solving & Algorithms: Solving coding challenges to sharpen logical thinking.
4)Automation: Writing small scripts to save time and make tasks easier.
